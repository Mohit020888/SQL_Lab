# SQL_Lab

This project contains a number of SQL exercises that can be used to practice SQL skills. The exercises are divided into three levels: beginner, intermediate, and advanced.

## Getting Started

To run the exercises, you will need to have a copy of SQL Server or MySQL installed on your computer. You can also use a cloud-based SQL database, such as Microsoft Azure SQL Database or Amazon RDS MySQL.

Once you have a SQL database, you can connect to it using a SQL client, such as Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio or MySQL Workbench.

To run an exercise, simply open the SQL script file in your SQL client and execute the queries.

## Beginner Exercises

The beginner exercises are designed to introduce you to the basics of SQL. They cover topics such as creating tables, inserting data, querying data, and updating data.

## Intermediate Exercises

The intermediate exercises are designed to challenge your SQL skills. They cover topics such as joins, subqueries, and aggregation functions.

## Advanced Exercises

The advanced exercises are designed to test your mastery of SQL. They cover topics such as window functions, triggers, and stored procedures.

## Tips
